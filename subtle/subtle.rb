# Styles define various properties of styleable items in a CSS-like syntax.

# If no background color is given no color will be set. This will ensure a

# == Gravities
#
# Gravities are predefined sizes a window can be set to. There are several ways
# to set a certain gravity, most convenient is to define a gravity via a tag or
# change them during runtime via grab. Subtler and subtlext can also modify
# gravities.
#
# A gravity consists of four values which are a percentage value of the screen
# size. The first two values are x and y starting at the center of the screen
# and he last two values are the width and height.
#
# === Example
#
# Following defines a gravity for a window with 100% width and height:
#
#   gravity :example, [ 0, 0, 100, 100 ]
#
# === Link
#
# http://subforge.org/projects/subtle/wiki/Gravity

#
# == Grabs
#
# Grabs are keyboard and mouse actions within subtle, every grab can be
# assigned either to a key and/or to a mouse button combination. A grab
# consists of a chain and an action.
#
# === Finding keys
#
# The best resource for getting the correct key names is
# */usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h*, but to make life easier here are some hints
# about it:
#
# * Numbers and letters keep their names, so *a* is *a* and *0* is *0*
# * Keypad keys need *KP_* as prefix, so *KP_1* is *1* on the keypad
# * Strip the *XK_* from the key names if looked up in
#   /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h
# * Keys usually have meaningful english names
# * Modifier keys have special meaning (Alt (A), Control (C), Meta (M),
#   Shift (S), Super (W))
#
# === Chaining
#
# Chains are a combination of keys and modifiers to one or a list of keys
# and can be used in various ways to trigger an action. In subtle, there are
# two ways to define chains for grabs:
#
#   1. *Default*: Add modifiers to a key and use it for a grab
#
#      *Example*: grab "W-Return", "urxvt"
#
#   2. *Chain*: Define a list of grabs that need to be pressed in order
#
#      *Example*: grab "C-y Return", "urxvt"
#
# ==== Mouse buttons
#
# [*B1*] = Button1 (Left mouse button)
# [*B2*] = Button2 (Middle mouse button)
# [*B3*] = Button3 (Right mouse button)
# [*B4*] = Button4 (Mouse wheel up)
# [*B5*] = Button5 (Mouse wheel down)
#
# ==== Modifiers
#
# [*A*] = Alt key
# [*C*] = Control key
# [*M*] = Meta key
# [*S*] = Shift key
# [*W*] = Super (Windows) key
#
# === Action
#
# An action is something that happens when a grab is activated, this can be one
# of the following:
#
# [*symbol*] Run a subtle action
# [*string*] Start a certain program
# [*array*]  Cycle through gravities
# [*lambda*] Run a Ruby proc
#
# === Example
#
# This will create a grab that starts a urxvt when Alt+Enter are pressed:
#
#   grab "A-Return", "urxvt"
#   grab "C-a c",    "urxvt"

#
# == Tags
#
# Tags are generally used in subtle for placement of windows. This placement is
# strict, that means that - aside from other tiling window managers - windows
# must have a matching tag to be on a certain view. This also includes that
# windows that are started on a certain view will not automatically be placed
# there.
#
# There are to ways to define a tag:
#
# === Simple
#
# The simple way just needs a name and a regular expression to just handle the
# placement:
#
# Example:
#
#  tag "terms", "terms"
#
# === Extended
#
# Additionally tags can do a lot more then just control the placement - they
# also have properties than can define and control some aspects of a window
# like the default gravity or the default screen per view.
#
# Example:
#
#  tag "terms" do
#    match   "xterm|[u]?rxvt"
#    gravity :center
#  end
#
# === Default
#
# Whenever a window has no tag it will get the default tag and be placed on the
# default view. The default view can either be set by the user with adding the
# default tag to a view by choice or otherwise the first defined view will be
# chosen automatically.
#
# === Properties
#
# [*float*]     This property either sets the tagged client floating or prevents
#               it from being floating depending on the value.
#
#               Example: float true
#
# [*full*]      This property either sets the tagged client to fullscreen or
#               prevents it from being set to fullscreen depending on the value.
#
#               Example: full true
#
# [*geometry*]  This property sets a certain geometry as well as floating mode
#               to the tagged client, but only on views that have this tag too.
#               It expects an array with x, y, width and height values whereas
#               width and height must be >0.
#
#               Example: geometry [100, 100, 50, 50]
#
# [*gravity*]   This property sets a certain to gravity to the tagged client,
#               but only on views that have this tag too.
#
#              Example: gravity :center
#
# [*match*]    This property adds matching patterns to a tag, a tag can have
#              more than one. Matching works either via plaintext, regex
#              (see man regex(7)) or window id. Per default tags will only
#              match the WM_NAME and the WM_CLASS portion of a client, this
#              can be changed with following possible values:
#
#              [*:name*]      Match the WM_NAME
#              [*:instance*]  Match the first (instance) part from WM_CLASS
#              [*:class*]     Match the second (class) part from WM_CLASS
#              [*:role*]      Match the window role
#
#              Example: match :instance => "urxvt"
#                       match [:role, :class] => "test"
#                       match "[xa]+term"
#
# [*exclude*]  This property works exactly the same way as *match*, but it
#              excludes clients that match from this tag. That can be helpful
#              with catch-all tags e.g. for console apps.
#
#              Example: exclude :instance => "irssi"
#
# [*resize*]   This property either enables or disables honoring of client
#              resize hints and is independent of the global option.
#
#              Example: resize true
#
# [*stick*]    This property either sets the tagged client to stick or prevents
#              it from being set to stick depending on the value. Stick clients
#              are visible on every view.
#
#              Example: stick true
#
# [*type*]     This property sets the [[Tagging|tagged]] client to be treated
#              as a specific window type though as the window sets the type
#              itself. Following types are possible:
#
#              [*:desktop*]  Treat as desktop window (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DESKTOP)
#              [*:dock*]     Treat as dock window (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK)
#              [*:toolbar*]  Treat as toolbar windows (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_TOOLBAR)
#              [*:splash*]   Treat as splash window (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_SPLASH)
#              [*:dialog*]   Treat as dialog window (_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DIALOG)
#
#              Example: type :desktop
#
# [*urgent*]   This property either sets the tagged client to be urgent or
#              prevents it from being urgent depending on the value. Urgent
#              clients will get keyboard and mouse focus automatically.
#
#              Example: urgent true

# == Sublets
#
# Sublets are Ruby scripts that provide data for the panel and can be managed
# with the sur script that comes with subtle.
#
# === Example
#
#  sur install clock
#  sur uninstall clock
#  sur list
#
# === Configuration
#
# All sublets have a set of configuration values that can be changed directly
# from the config of subtle.
#
# There are three default properties, that can be be changed for every sublet:
#
# [*interval*]    Update interval of the sublet
# [*foreground*]  Default foreground color
# [*background*]  Default background color
#
# sur can also give a brief overview about properties:
#
# === Example
#
#   sur config clock
#
# The syntax of the sublet configuration is similar to other configuration
# options in subtle:
#
# === Example
#
sublet :clock do
  interval      60
  foreground    "#eeeeee"
  format_string "%H:%M"
end
sublet :battery do
  interval 60
  foreground  "#eeeeee"
end
sublet :volume do
  icon_fg "#e67373"
end
